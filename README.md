# NOCFO Homework Assignment

Hi there, and thank you for showing interest in our company! The homework assignment is built on top of [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/), so first, you need to install the dependencies and start the Storybook server. Then, you will see the instructions for the actual task. Let's get started:

## 1. Use this repository as a template to create your own repository

Create your own GitHub repository by clicking "Use this template" at the top of this page. Check out the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).

## 2. Clone your repository to your local machine

Next, clone the repository to your local machine.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repository-name>.git
```

## 3. Install dependencies (including dev dependencies)

The project is set up with npm. Navigate to your project folder and install the dependencies by running:

```sh
npm install --also=dev
```

## 4. Start Storybook

The homework assignment is set up with Storybook. Start Storybook by running:

```sh
npm run storybook
```

## 5. Begin the assignment

Storybook should open your browser automatically. If not, navigate to [http://localhost:6006/](http://localhost:6006/). You should now see the instructions for the assignment. Good luck!

## 6. Submit your work

Deliver a link to your public GitHub repository with the solution. The link can be delivered to us via email [kiira.ojala@atalent.fi](mailto:kiira.ojala@atalent.fi?subject=NOCFO%20homework%20deliverable&body=Here%20is%20the%20link%20to%20my%20GitHub%20repository:%20<PASTE%20LINK%20HERE>). We will review your work and get back to you as soon as possible. **Deadline for the assignment is on Monday 4.3.2024 at 8:00.**
